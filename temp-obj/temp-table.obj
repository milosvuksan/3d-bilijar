# Pockets are not modeled as geometry, but you can add visual cues for their positions:
# Corners: (-1.5, -3.0), (1.5, -3.0), (-1.5, 3.0), (1.5, 3.0)
# Sides: (0, -3.0), (0, 3.0)
# If you want to model actual holes, you would need to create a mesh with circular cutouts at these positions.
# For most billiard visualizations, the holes are rendered in the shader or as black spheres (as in your JS code).
